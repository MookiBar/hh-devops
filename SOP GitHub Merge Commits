STEPS FOR MERGING TO MAIN

Create a New Branch
When creating changes and adding new code, create a new branch
Command: git checkout -b <branch>
<branch> is the name of the new branch that you are creating
To switch branches: git checkout <branch>
To show current branch: git branch - -show-current
Alternatively: git status
To push branch if it does NOT exist on remote repo: git push -u origin <branch>
As you do work in your own branch, continue to commit and push to that branch as often as you want.
You can create and manipulate branches through your IDE or through your command line.

Create a Pull Request
When ready to merge to main, create a pull request
You can create a pull request through your IDE or through GitHub
Wes/ Admin will review code change and either approve for merge or ask for updates to be made prior to merge being made (this can be viewed and approved easily through GitHub)
Pull requests can be opened and closed in GitHub

Delete Branch
Once merge is successfully made, new branch can be deleted
To delete remote branch: git push origin - - delete <branch>
To delete local branch: git branch -d <branch>
Branch can also be deleted through GitHub
